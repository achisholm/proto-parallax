## Icon font
For nice, sharp, scalable vector icons, all of the icons throughout the site have been bundled into an icon font generated by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io), a free service for editing and generating icon font sets.

#### Initial Setup

These are the steps that I carried out to set up the icon font for this project :

  1. Use Icomoon to create the icon set. Select or upload icons
  2. In preferences, the default settings are mostly fine but I customised the following -
    - for Font Name use `iconfont`
    - and Class Prefix use `icon--`
  3. Download and unzip the icomoon.zip file
  4. Copy or move the `fonts` folder into the public root (in this case `/`) folder of your project
  5. Copy/move the `selection.json` file into the fonts folder
  6. Copy/move the contents of the style.css file into `scss/tools/_iconfont.scss`
  7. Edit the @font-face src paths at the top of the file to the correct location (normally `/fonts...`)
  8. Import the file into your main.scss file - `@import "tools/iconfont";`

#### Using the Iconfont

The most common way of using the iconfont in markup is like this : 

```html
<button>
  <span class="icon icon--car"></span> Car
</button>
```
... which will give you a button with a label that looks like ":car: Car"

There are a few other methods which you can read about in the [Icomoon Docs](https://icomoon.io/#docs).

#### Editing or updating the icon font

If you ever need to edit or update the icon set, you can import the Icomoon project and re-generate the icon font with your changes...
  1. Visit the Icomoon website
  2. Click on the **Icomoon App** button
  3. Click on the **Import Icons** button and select the `selection.json` file that is stored in the `fonts` folder
  4. Make the required updates to the icon set
  5. Download the new font
  6. Overwrite the existing `fonts` folder with your new one
  7. Add or remove any changed rules in `scss/_tools.iconfont.scss` to correspond with the new `style.css` file and Save
